What is this purpose of this Git repository?
- On the surface, I submit my labs and assignments for COMP20 by this Git 
repository.
- GitHub is a powful tool for programmers. Knowing how to use it will benifit my
future studying in computer science. This repository is not only for the 
instructor to grade what I have done, but also for me to show my work to someone 
else.


What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
- Lab 3: Git/GitHub. 
- After this lab, I get the ability to do following things:
	1. Study from other engineers' codes on GitHub. There are many geeks posting
	their codes/programs/thoughts by Git.
	2. Learn how to do team work (not only for the team project of this course). 
	I found GitHub is a good community to let people all around the world do 
	group work together. 
		e.g. Homebrew, which we used for lab8, is a product built by people from
		different countries on GitHub.
- In a word, lab 3 taught me how to use a tool.


How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
- Day 1: I know nothing about web programming. I even never heard of CSS before.
- Now: I know how to learn web programming, even computer science. The "Teaching 
Style and Expectations" of the instruction lecture of day 1 is not abstract to 
me any more. I really understand what Ming said: "You are responsible for your 
own learning. If you want everything gone over in lecture, then this is not the 
course for you. More importantly, that's not how things work in real life. It is
your responsibility to ask questions early and to ask for help. You will learn 
by doing, by asking questions, by making mistakes, and by working with others.
You will learn how to teach yourself and to explore. We will cover a lot in 
little time because the web development stack is so big now. You will start to 
be a professional."


What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two 
examples as evidence.
- From read materials and references that the instructor gave us, I know there 
are a lot of good online resources about web programming.
	e.g. Stackoverflow for asking questions.
	e.g. Asciinema blog for watching other's coding.
 

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper 
into?
- Web security. (Ming is basically right about web security. But China is a 
friendly country and I love my country!!!)
