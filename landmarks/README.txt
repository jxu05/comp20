1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
implement:
- The HTML file must be named index.html in a folder named landmarks in your private Git repository. You can write your JavaScript in the HTML file.
- You must use at least one (1) CSS file. You can name the file whatever you want.
- You must use the JavaScript navigator.geolocation object to retrieve your geolocation information (latitude and longitude).
- You must use the JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object to make requests (i.e., send your information) and manage the response data.
- You must display your location on the map with unique marker (i.e., using an image of your choice) and info window with a note of your login after retrieving information from navigator.geolocation.
- You must display locations of people in the class on the map. That is, there will be markers on the map denoting people. Clicking on a marker will display person's login and mile(s) away from you in an info window. A unique icon for a person must be used (the image can be anything); all people markers on map will use the same icon.

not yet:
You must display all landmarks within one mile of your current location on the map. Clicking on a marker will display landmark's details in an info window. A unique icon for a landmark must be used (the image can be anything); all landmark markers on map will use the same icon.
On clicking your own marker, open an info window that shows the name of the closest historic landmark from you and the distance between you and that historic landmark in miles. You must also render a polyline between your current location and that closest historic landmark.
